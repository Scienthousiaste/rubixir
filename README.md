#Rubixir

Welcome to Rubixir, a Rubik's Cube sandbox built in Elixir, accompanied by a 3D visualization in three.js on a Phoenix server.

## Build and run the project

To build Rubixir, one needs:
	- to install Elixir (sufficient to build the rubik executable)
	- to install Phoenix
	- to have node/npm installed, and to install the dependencies of the server by running the command "npm install" in rubixi/visu/assets

If you're on MacOS, running the macos_setup_elixir.sh should install elixir and phoenix, otherwise please refer to https://elixir-lang.org/install.html and https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/installation.html#content.

The rubik executable is then created by running "mix escript.build" in the rubik folder.
The visu development server is launched by running "mix phx.server" in the visu folder, and can be seen in action by opening localhost:4000 in a browser.
