# Rubik

Rubik is the API part of the Rubixir project, a Rubik's Cube sandbox developped by Timoth√©e Behra for the 42 project Rubik. It is written entirely in elixir. 
The solution to a Rubik's Cube computed by rubixir uses the Fridrich advanced CFOP method, very popular among speed cubers.

## Installation
